# Restaurant-Shuffle
A Java program to provide user with a random restaurant in their area.
User may also enter price range they desire ($,$$,$$$,$$$), and categories of food they want. Feel free to take a look at our code or download the .exe to run the program.
If you want to play with the code, replace "key" in utilities.java with your own Yelp API key. https://www.yelp.com/developers/v3/manage_app
